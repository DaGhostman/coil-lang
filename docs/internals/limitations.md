# Known limitations and workarounds

Actionable gaps in the compiler, VM, and language surface. For opcode/archive rules see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md); for typechecker error codes see [error-codes.md](../references/error-codes.md).

**Design rule:** prefer **method-based APIs** (`impl` methods on classes) over free functions for type-tied operations — stdlib, new language features, and codegen fixes should default to methods. Virtual-module host primitives (`io::read`) remain free functions.

**Priority key:** blocking = correctness crash or major feature blocked; high = reliability or significant DX gap; medium = partial support; low = deferred polish.

## Parser / surface (low–medium)

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| `coil.toml` `preludes` / `strict` | Not implemented — [project-config.md](../references/project-config.md) |
| `import` keyword | Not implemented (use `use`) |
| `case` as `match` alias | Not in grammar |
| Range `collect` | `collect(0..5)` deferred; non-numeric `Ord` ranges not iterable |
| Duplicate record fields | Not rejected at parse time (typechecker reports) |

## Userland footguns

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| `Option` field moves | `match` moves fields out — copy links before nested `match` on the same field |
| Cross-module user classes | Userland class types not importable across modules (e.g. `HashSet` wrapper) |
| User trait calls | Dictionary passing; only ground builtin bounds get direct monomorphized opcodes |

## IL optimizations (low)

GVN has no SSA slot rename; effectful ops are barriers. Per-function `multi_op_join_convoy` can mis-sink on JMPF diamonds — whole-buffer pass required. Fuse-select intentionally conservative during JMP migration.

## Tracking

Most items have no inline `TODO`/`FIXME` — knowledge lives here and in [.cursor/skills/coil-contributor/reference.md](../../.cursor/skills/coil-contributor/reference.md). Update this file when closing a limitation.
